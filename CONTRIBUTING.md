## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/safe-mcp-scanner.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- uv (Python package manager) - [Installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Setup with uv (Recommended)
```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safe-mcp-scanner.git
cd safe-mcp-scanner

# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run the scanner
uv run safe-mcp-scan --help
```

### Alternative Setup with pip
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safe-mcp-scanner.git
cd safe-mcp-scanner

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Development Tools
We use the following tools for development:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff**: Linting and code quality
- **MyPy**: Type checking
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (with uv)
uv run pre-commit install

# Run code quality checks with uv
uv run black src/
uv run ruff check src/
uv run mypy src/

# Or without uv (if using pip)
black src/
ruff check src/
mypy src/
```

## Code Style

### Python Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules

### Example:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from pathlib import Path

def scan_mcp_config(
    config_path: Path,
    techniques: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """Scan MCP configuration file for vulnerabilities.
    
    Args:
        config_path: Path to the MCP configuration file
        techniques: Optional list of SAFE-MCP technique IDs to check
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping technique IDs to found vulnerabilities
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If config file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If config file is malformed
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commit format with DCO signoff:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Examples:
- `feat(detector): add SAFE-T1001 malicious description detection`
- `fix(cli): resolve output format selection bug`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)
All commits must be signed off to indicate that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

```bash
# Sign off your commits automatically
git commit -s -m "feat: add new detection technique"

# Or add signoff to existing commit
git commit --amend --signoff

# Configure git to always sign off
git config --global format.signoff true
```

The signoff certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as open-source.

## Adding Detection Techniques

### 1. Choose a SAFE-MCP Technique
Reference the [SAFE-MCP framework](https://github.com/fkautz/safe-mcp) to select a technique to implement.

### 2. Create Detection Module
Create a new file in `src/safe_mcp_scanner/techniques/`:

```python
# src/safe_mcp_scanner/techniques/safe_t1001.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from ..detectors.base import BaseDetector, Finding

class MaliciousDescriptionDetector(BaseDetector):
    """Detector for SAFE-T1001: Malicious Tool Descriptions."""
    
    technique_id = "SAFE-T1001"
    technique_name = "Malicious Tool Descriptions"
    tactic = "Initial Access"
    
    def scan(self, target: Any) -> List[Finding]:
        """Scan for malicious tool descriptions."""
        findings = []
        # Detection logic here
        return findings
```

### 3. Add Detection Patterns
Define patterns in the appropriate detector:

```python
MALICIOUS_PATTERNS = [
    r"<!--.*?-->",  # Hidden HTML comments
    r"\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}",  # Unicode escapes
    r"(ignore|disregard|forget).*(previous|above|instruction)",
]
```

### 4. Write Tests
Create comprehensive tests in `tests/test_techniques/`:

```python
# tests/test_techniques/test_safe_t1001.py
import pytest
from safe_mcp_scanner.techniques.safe_t1001 import MaliciousDescriptionDetector

def test_malicious_description_detection():
    detector = MaliciousDescriptionDetector()
    # Test cases here
    pass
```

### 5. Add Documentation
Update technique documentation in `docs/techniques/SAFE-T1001.md`.

## Testing

### Running Tests with uv
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=safe_mcp_scanner

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_scanner.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run tests in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto
```

### Running Tests without uv
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=safe_mcp_scanner
```

### Test Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete scanning workflows
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% code coverage
- **Test Data**: Use fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`

### Test Categories
1. **Detector Tests**: Verify detection accuracy
2. **Scanner Tests**: Test scanning orchestration
3. **Reporter Tests**: Verify output formatting
4. **CLI Tests**: Test command-line interface
5. **Configuration Tests**: Test config file handling

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation
- **Code Documentation**: Docstrings and inline comments
