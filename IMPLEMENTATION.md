## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Development Approach
We'll follow an iterative approach, building core functionality first and expanding technique coverage progressively:

1. **Foundation First**: Core framework, CLI, and basic detection engine
2. **High-Impact Techniques**: Focus on the most critical SAFE-MCP techniques
3. **Reporting & Integration**: Comprehensive output formats and CI/CD integration
4. **Technique Expansion**: Implement remaining SAFE-MCP techniques
5. **Advanced Features**: Real-time monitoring, plugins, and performance optimization

### Development Principles
- **Security by Design**: Every component designed with security considerations
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written before or alongside implementation
- **Defensive Programming**: Robust error handling and input validation
- **Performance Awareness**: Efficient algorithms and resource management
- **Documentation First**: Clear documentation for maintainability

## Design Decisions

### 1. Language Choice: Python 3.9+
**Rationale:**
- Excellent libraries for AST parsing (`ast` module)
- Rich ecosystem for security tools (Bandit, Safety, etc.)
- Strong JSON/YAML parsing capabilities
- Good CLI framework options (Click)
- Wide adoption in security community

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Rapid development and prototyping
- ✅ Extensive security tool ecosystem
- ✅ Easy integration with CI/CD systems
- ❌ Potentially slower than compiled languages
- ❌ GIL limitations for CPU-bound tasks

### 2. Plugin Architecture
**Rationale:**
- Easy to add new SAFE-MCP techniques
- Community contributions encouraged
- Modular testing and maintenance
- Technique-specific optimizations possible

**Implementation:**
- Decorator-based technique registration
- Abstract base classes for consistency
- Dynamic loading with error isolation
- Configuration-driven enable/disable

### 3. Multiple Detection Engines
**Rationale:**
- Different file types require different analysis approaches
- AST analysis for code, pattern matching for configs
- Allows technique-specific optimization
- Provides redundancy and cross-validation

**Engines:**
- **AST Analyzer**: Python and JavaScript code analysis
- **Pattern Matcher**: Regex-based detection for all file types
- **Config Analyzer**: Structured analysis of JSON/YAML
- **Package Analyzer**: Dependency and supply chain analysis

### 4. SARIF Output Format
**Rationale:**
- Industry standard for static analysis tools
- Excellent IDE integration (VS Code, GitHub)
- Rich metadata support for findings
- Enables tool interoperability

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Standard format adoption
- ✅ Built-in remediation guidance
- ✅ Tool ecosystem compatibility
- ✅ Structured result metadata

### 5. Configuration Hierarchy
**Rationale:**
- Flexibility for different use cases
- Enterprise-friendly with system-wide configs
- Project-specific customization
- CLI override capabilities

**Hierarchy (highest to lowest priority):**
1. Command-line arguments
2. Project configuration (`.safe-mcp-scanner.yaml`)
3. User configuration (`~/.config/safe-mcp-scanner/`)
4. System configuration (`/etc/safe-mcp-scanner/`)
5. Default built-in configuration
