## Overview

SAFE-MCP Scanner is a defensive security tool that identifies vulnerabilities in MCP server implementations by detecting 77+ documented attack techniques across 14 tactical categories. Built upon the SAFE-MCP framework, it adapts MITRE ATT&CK methodology specifically for MCP environments.

## Features

- üîç **Comprehensive Detection**: 77+ attack techniques across 14 SAFE-MCP tactical categories
- üèóÔ∏è **Multiple Analysis Methods**: Static code analysis, configuration scanning, pattern matching
- üìä **Rich Reporting**: JSON, SARIF, HTML output formats with MITRE ATT&CK correlation
- üöÄ **CI/CD Ready**: Exit codes, thresholds, and automated scanning capabilities
- üîß **Extensible**: Plugin-based architecture for custom detection rules
- üì¶ **Multi-Format**: Supports Python, JavaScript, JSON, YAML, Docker configurations

## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safe-mcp-scanner
cd safe-mcp-scanner
uv sync
```

### Using pip

```bash
# From PyPI (when released)
pip install safe-mcp-scanner

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safe-mcp-scanner
cd safe-mcp-scanner
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### With uv

```bash
# Basic scanning
uv run safe-mcp-scan scan /path/to/mcp/server

# Scan with configuration
uv run safe-mcp-scan scan --config mcp_config.json

# Generate SARIF report
uv run safe-mcp-scan scan /path --output sarif --file report.sarif

# Filter by severity
uv run safe-mcp-scan scan /path --min-severity high

# CI/CD integration
uv run safe-mcp-scan scan /path --exit-code --max-high 0
```

### With pip

```bash
# Basic scanning
safe-mcp-scan scan /path/to/mcp/server

# Scan with configuration
safe-mcp-scan scan --config mcp_config.json

# Generate SARIF report
safe-mcp-scan scan /path --output sarif --file report.sarif

# Filter by severity
safe-mcp-scan scan /path --min-severity high

# CI/CD integration
safe-mcp-scan scan /path --exit-code --max-high 0
```
